Being able to write your own functions gives you a lot of flexibility and control as a WordPress developer. It can be tempting to put your function code in the theme template file, but that is much less flexible than putting it in your own plugin.

In this Coffee Break Course you'll learn how to write a first simple function that can be used anywhere in your theme template files. Even better, you'll be creating your function in a plugin—best practice for coding WordPress.
